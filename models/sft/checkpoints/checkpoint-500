## Contents

- **pytorch_model.bin**: The model weights saved in PyTorch format.
- **optimizer.pt**: The state of the optimizer at this checkpoint.
- **scheduler.pt**: The state of the learning rate scheduler.
- **training_args.bin**: The training arguments used for this checkpoint.

Make sure to load this checkpoint using the appropriate model class and configuration to continue training or perform inference.
